#### GitHub Account
You will need a personal GitHub account for today's workshop. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com/join).

#### Lab Setup
Within the web interface, we will be running commands directly against our cluster using what is known as the [Web Terminal Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/web_console/web_terminal/installing-web-terminal.html). This allows us to establish a session with the cluster using the currently logged in user, and all the required tooling (e.g. [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) command line tools) is made available.

#### SSH Session
So our first step will be to SSH into the jump host. Details will be provided by the instructor providing the command to run and the required password.

It will look similar to this: **ssh student01@3.104.30...**
